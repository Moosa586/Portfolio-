  <h3 class="intro">Introduction</h3>
  

  <p class="para1">Hello! I'm Muhammad Moosa, a passionate and dedicated Web Developer with a strong interest in creating dynamic, responsive, and user friendly digital experiences.
I enjoy turning ideas into real-life projects through clean design, efficient code, and modern web technologies. My main focus is to build websites that not only look great but also perform seamlessly across all devices.

I have hands on experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a growing knowledge of backend technologies like Python (Flask/Django) and MySQL. I love exploring new tools and frameworks that help me improve my workflow and bring innovative ideas to life.

Over time, Iâ€™ve worked on different kinds of projects from simple static websites to interactive web applications, learning how to manage both design and functionality effectively. My goal is always to write code thatâ€™s clean, maintainable, and efficient.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m deeply interested in learning new technologies, solving real-world problems, and collaborating with other developers to create meaningful products. I believe every project, no matter how small, is a chance to grow, learn, and create something valuable.

When Iâ€™m not coding, I spend my time exploring new design trends, improving my problem-solving skills, and staying updated with the latest developments in the tech world.

Iâ€™m currently looking for exciting opportunities where I can contribute my skills, grow as a developer, and work on projects that make a difference.</p>
